###HTTP Channel

######Description

The HTTP channel is a generic channel to enable bindings to arbitrary REST endpoints. It is the most flexible channel that can be adapted to the needs of your service. It supports both anonymous requests and basic authorization headers. 

######Actions

 Action Name   |   Action Settings   |   Values   |   Examples|
|------|------|------|-------|
JsonRequest    |    Verb*, Url*, Body, Username, Password, Response Template    |   {GET|PUT|POST|DELETE}    |

######Additional Details

This action sends a request to the URL given as an action setting. Depending on the Verb setting the request can be a GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE request. If a basic authorization header should be added, the Username or Password setting (or both) cannot be empty. 

For POST and PUT, a body for the request can be given in the Body setting. If a value for that setting is given, it has to be in JSON format (the request is sent with content type “application/json”). Also, a response is expected to be in JSON format. Note, that values within single curly brackets will be treated as references to action settings like in any other action setting. Therefore, all brackets in the body have to be escaped by doubling them. For example, imagine a service expects the following JSON body: 
```
{
  "Animals":
  [
    {
      "Animal":"fox",
      "Attribute":"quick brown"
    },
    {
      "Animal":"dog",
      "Attribute":"lazy"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note you should escape the brackets (with an additional “{“) to list the values in the Body setting (see below)
{{
```
"Animals":
  [
    {{
      "Animal":"fox",
      "Attribute":"quick brown"
    }},
    {{
      "Animal":"dog",
      "Attribute":"{builtin.attribute}"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

This way you can still use placeholders for action within the setting, for example, to set the value of a field (see attribute value in example).

If the ResponseTemplate action setting is empty, the response will be the JSON returned from the service. However, using the ResponseTemplate you can construct a natural language response from the fields of the JSON structure using a JPath expression within double curly brackets. Again, anything within single curly brackets will be treated as a reference to an action parameter. For example, imagine your service returns a JSON structure like the one displayed above. Then you can construct a natural language response using the response template like this: 

The ```{{Animals[0].Attribute}} {{Animals[0].Animal}} jumps over the {{Animals[1].Attribute}} {{Animals[1].Animal}}```. 

The expected response would then be: ```The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.```
If not all placeholders can be filled from the JSON, they will be left empty. If the service returns an error status code, this error code will be shown to the user instead. 

###News Channel

Prebuilt app: You can download a prebuilt app supporting our sample utterances for this action [here](https://www.luis.ai/Content/sampleApps/Build_Weather_v1.1.json).

######Additional Details

The weather zone channel returns the climate conditions of the given location. A location can be a city, a state, or a country. If a location is not known to the system, an error message will be returned by the action. There is a distinction between the current weather and forecasts for a given location. The current weather and temperature actions return data that represents the actual conditions, like current temperature, condition, wind directions and strength. You cannot specify a date or time for these values. The other intents use the forecast data and thus provide predicted data instead of actual values. Overview data (forecast summary) is available for the day and upcoming night of a specific date. The forecast range is limited to “today” and 6 days into the future. Any attempt to go beyond these boundaries will result in an error response.
