###Language Understanding Intelligent Services (LUIS) brings the growing power and simplicity of artificial intelligence to your apps.

######Benefits to using LUIS

Localization support (UI always in English, but English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Chinese supported utterances)

Here’s how it works
One of the key problems in human-computer interactions is the ability of the computer to understand what a person wants, and to find the pieces of information that are relevant to their intent. For example, in a news-browsing app, you might say "Get news about virtual reality companies," in which case there is the intention to "Find news", and "virtual reality companies" is the topic. LUIS is designed to enable you to quickly deploy an http endpoint that will take the sentences you send it, and interpret them in terms of the intention they convey, and the key entities like "virtual reality companies" that are present. LUIS lets you custom design the set of intentions and entities that are relevant to the application, and then guides you through the process of building a language understanding system. 
Intent is action verb and entity is the topic (of intent)
Once your application is deployed and traffic starts to flow into the system, LUIS uses active learning to improve itself. In the active learning process, LUIS identifies the interactions that it is relatively unsure of, and asks you to label them according to intent and entities. This has tremendous advantages: LUIS knows what it is unsure of, and asks you to help where you will provide the maximum improvement in system performance. Secondly, by focusing on the important cases, LUIS learns as quickly as possible, and takes the minimum amount of your time.

For years, people have thought of bots — automated online tools that perform all sorts of tasks — as annoying digital critters that do a bad job of substituting for humans in call centers or that inflate traffic numbers by pretending to read websites.
